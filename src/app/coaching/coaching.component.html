        IELTS is an English language exam that is required to be taken by international candidates considering 
        studying or working in a country where English is the main language of communication. Most popular countries
        where IELTS is accepted for university admissions are the UK, Australia, New Zealand, USA, and Canada. 
        The exam mainly measures the ability of test-takers to communicate in the four basic English language skills – 
        listening, reading, speaking, and writing. IELTS exam is jointly owned and conducted by IDP Education Australia,
        British Council, and Cambridge English Language Assessment.

    <h2>Why IELTS Exam is required?</h2>
    <p>IELTS 2019 exam is required for migration as well as academic purpose abroad in English speaking countries like 
        Australia, UK, New Zealand, USA, and Canada. 
        It is the only English Language Test approved by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) for visa applicants applying 
        both outside and inside the UK. A lot of students get confused about why are the IELTS scores required. 
        The simple answer to this is that foreign universities and visa granting authorities need to be sure that you will not have communication issues while staying in the country. You need to show a good understanding and strong command of the English language and that is why your overall IELTS scores are so important. Another common doubt students have is whether IELTS is a compulsory exam or not. No, IELTS isn’t compulsory in all university admissions. Many universities might not even require IELTS scores for admission purposes. But remember that if you don’t give IELTS, your chances of getting the student visa might suffer as the visa officers may not be convinced about your English proficiency without IELTS scores. So it is safer to appear for IELTS and aim to
        score at least 6 bands overall.
        
        You can take the IELTS exam with the British Council or IDP up to once a week (four times a month).

    <h2>Types of IELTS</h2>

        are the same for both these tests, however, the subject matter for the writing and reading sections are different 
        depending on which test one takes. The Reading, Writing and Listening sections of the IELTS tests are completed 
        on the same day of the test with no breaks between them. However, the Speaking section can be completed either a 
        week before or after the other tests date. This information test can be taken from your test centre. Read: Which
